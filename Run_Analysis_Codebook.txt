The assignment requested that we calculate the mean value for those fields that contain are already a mean or Standard Deviation.  I selected only those measures that specifically contained the phrases

...mean()...
...std()...

This results in having selected 66 unique measures.  A list is provided below.

Since each of these measures is then averaged the summary results that I have posted takes the existing column name and appends Avg to the front of each column name.
